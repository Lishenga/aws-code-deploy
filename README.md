## Details

The action provides 2 modes of operation:

**Upload**

Upload the application (as a zip file) to an S3 bucket, and register a new application revision with CodeDeploy.

By default, the zip file is uploaded to an S3 bucket following the naming convention ```<application_name>-codedeploy-deployment```, which can be overridden
with the `S3_BUCKET` parameter.

The uploaded zip artifact will be named `<application_name>-<build_number>-<commit>`, which can be overridden with the `VERSION_LABEL` parameter.
 

**Deploy**

Deploy a previously uploaded application revision to a deployment group.

By default, the revision S3 bucket containing the revision follows the naming convention ```<application_name>-codedeploy-deployment```, which can be overridden
with the `S3_BUCKET` parameter.

The action will attempt to deploy the application revision matching `<application_name>-<build_number>-<commit>`, which can be overridden with the `VERSION_LABEL` parameter,
and wait until deployment has succeeded.

**Caveats**

*  When you use the `deploy` mode with the default `VERSION_LABEL`, the action will generate a new version label based on the build number and commit hash, so you need to make sure to also run the action
with the `upload` mode withing the same workflow so the corresponding version is preset in S3. If you don't run the `upload` part of the action in the same workflow, you should use explicit `VERSION_LABEL`,
for example, use semantic or other versioning scheme that is decoupled from the build number.
 

## Prerequisites
* An IAM user is configured with sufficient permissions to allow the action to perform a deployment to your application and upload artifacts to the S3 bucket.
* You have configured a CodeDeploy Application and Deployment Group. Here is a simple tutorial from AWS: [Deploy Code to a Virtual Machine](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/deploy-code-vm/)
* An S3 bucket has been set up to which deployment artifacts will be copied.




## Examples

### Upload
Upload the application `build.zip` to custom S3 bucket called `bucket`, with the application uploaded to S3 as `app-1.0.0`.
 
```yaml
jobs:
  upload-app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: upload app on bucket
    steps:
      - name: use upload command
        id: upload
        uses: gamezop/aws-code-deploy@v1
        with:
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: '$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
          COMMAND: 'upload'
          APPLICATION_NAME: 'application'
          ZIP_FILE: 'build.zip'
          S3_BUCKET: 'bucket'
          VERSION_LABEL: 'app-1.0.0'
```

### Deploy
Start a deployment and wait for it to finish. The application revision `application-<build-number>-<commit>` from the S3 bucket `application-codedeploy-deployment` will be deployed.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy app
    steps:
      - name: use deploy command
        id: deploy
        uses: gamezop/aws-code-deploy@v1
        with:
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: '$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
          COMMAND: 'deploy'
          APPLICATION_NAME: 'application'
          DEPLOYMENT_GROUP: 'deployment-group'
          WAIT: 'true'
```
